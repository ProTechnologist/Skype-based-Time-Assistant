Skype based Time Assistant
==========================

Inspiration
==========================
The company that I'm working for uses Skype to track employees' break timings, attendance, etc. In addition, we've a limited allowed time for breaks before going overbreak.

I found myself consistently calculating break minutes so to make sure that I have no overbreaks and this activity usually takes 20 to 40 minutes of productivity time so I wrote an application that calculates everything for me.

Technical Specs
==========================
This application connects to the Skype database, computes the break time, remind for the hourly updates and also generates a workable daily progress report.
