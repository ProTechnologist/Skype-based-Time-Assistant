Inspiration
==========================
The company that I'm working for uses Skype to track employees' break timings, attendance, etc. In addition, we've a limited allowed time for breaks before going overbreak.

I found myself consistently calculating break minutes so to make sure that I have no overbreaks and this activity usually takes 15 to 25 minutes of productivity time so I wrote an application that calculates everything for me.


About
==========================
This application connects to the Skype database, computes the break time, remind for the hourly updates and also generates a workable daily progress report. Furthermore, it also allows Team Leaders and others to see the break timings of their team members.


Technical Specs
==========================
WinForms, C#, Sqlite, Skype, Win32 API, NuGet.
